# WeatherApp
WeatherApp is an app that displays weather from a location of a user's choosing. It was done as a part of Project 2, and it uses OpenWeatherMap API, Retrofit, and Room DB (for persistence/offline use) as the backend, and is written in Kotlin. There are three main screens: current weather information, forecast, and settings. The user also has an option to pick the location from Google Maps.

This app was done in collaboration with other students, and a version in this repo is a fork of the main repo.
